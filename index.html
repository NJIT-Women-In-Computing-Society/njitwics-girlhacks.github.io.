        <h1>Who Are We?</h1>
        <p>GirlHacks is a 24-hour MLH sanctioned hackathon focused on empowering women and non-binary students in STEM, while welcoming all college and high school participants aged 18 and older. We bring together teams of up to four to create innovative projects, supported by industry mentors, workshops, and tech talks. Our mission is to foster an inclusive environment where diverse students can collaborate, learn, and showcase their skills, regardless of gender, education level, or institution.</p>

        <h1>Our Origins</h1>
        <p>GirlHacks stemmed from the <a href="http://www.njitwics.com/">Women in Computing Society</a> (WiCS) at the <a href="http://www.njit.edu/">New Jersey Institute of Technology</a> (NJIT). WiCS is an organization that supports NJIT's growing community of women studying in the fields of computing and technology. Through WiCS, members develop their skill set at student-hosted workshops, participate in mentorship, and network at national conferences. GirlHacks aspires to extend this mission and to create NJIT's women-centric hackathon!</p>
